# Pi-Polaroid

This project started as a school electrical engineering project where we used a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 to build and develop various functionalities such as image processing, display handling, and client-server communication. The initial setup involved assembling the Pi Z2W with additional hardware components, including a display, camera, buttons, and a custom 3D-printed enclosure. 

Now, this project has evolved into a personal endeavor to bend its initial setup and expand its functionalities using web sockets for real-time communication. This involves sending and processing images captured by the Pi's camera across the network to a client in my home lab setup. By leveraging the knowledge and skills gained from the course, I'm working on integrating this setup into my home lab environment, enhancing the image processing capabilities, and experimenting with additional custom features for a more robust and versatile application.
