# Pi-Polaroid

This project started as a school electrical engineering project where we used a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 to build and develop various functionalities such as image processing, display handling, and client-server communication. The initial setup involved assembling the Pi Z2W with additional hardware components, including a display, camera, buttons, and a custom 3D-printed enclosure.
